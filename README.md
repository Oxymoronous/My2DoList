# My2DoList
We all need a to-do list app.
I am just starting to learn how to make an app with Java.
So, simple Android to do list app it is.
The UI itself suffices how the app works.

About installing it and running it on your device, the method I know is:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Android Studio on your device (like laptop).
3. Connect your Android phone to your device. 
4. Turn on "Developer options" and "Enable USB debugging" on your phone. (Google how)
5. Connect your phone to your device.
6. Open this project on Android studio.
7. In Android studio, connect your phone from Android Studio's Device Manager.
8. Run the app from Android studio.
9. Voila! You should see the app running on your phone and it is automatically installed.
